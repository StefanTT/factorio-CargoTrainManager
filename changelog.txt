    - Migrate existing requesters to new comparision logic introduced in 1.0.4 if
      the condition is compatible. The train station's maximum number of trains is set
      to 1 if it is unset (for the train stations with converted requesters).

Version 1.0.4
Date: 2021-04-08
  New feature:
    - Requester's logic condition can now be set to e.g. "iron-plate > 0" instead of
      "iron-plate > number-of-incoming-trains". This allows multiple requests to be handled in
      parallel. Use a station's train limit to control the maximum number of trains that are
      being sent.
    - Attached requester / station dialogs to the entities main dialog window.
    - Show a warning message in the requester's GUI if the requester is not connected to
      a logic network.
  Bugfix:
    - Ensure requests are not added multiple times as pending deliveries.
    - Avoid crash when management console's pending deliveries tab is opened
      while having an active unconfigured requester.
